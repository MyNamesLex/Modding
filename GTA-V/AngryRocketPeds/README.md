# AngryRocketPeds

Credit to <a href = "https://github.com/Toooble"> Toooble </a> for bug fixes and watching me spend 2 hours without realising I forgot to start the timer in the Start() function :)

Runs as soon as the scripts load

Makes all pedestrians within a radius shoot rockets at the player for a random amount of time and after a random amount of time has passed
