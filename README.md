# Modding
 
Currently, I have modded Skyrim and GTAV, looking into modding more games for fun and to learn more about the game

Skyrim - Skyrim Creation Kit

GTAV - C# using <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/script-hook-v">Scripthook.API</a>

Cyberpunk - Currently looking into Lua using <a href="https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyber-engine-tweaks/">Cyber Engine Tweaks</a>
