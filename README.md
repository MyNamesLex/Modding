# Modding
 
I have currently modded GTAV and Cyberpunk 2077, looking into modding more games for fun and to learn more about the game

GTAV - C# using <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/script-hook-v">Scripthook.API</a>

Cyberpunk - Lua using <a href="https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyber-engine-tweaks/introduction">Cyber Engine Tweaks</a> with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518">Native Settings UI</a>
